# startProject

The goal of `startProject` is to create a project directory with
sub-folders, document and templates (.docx, .R, .Rmd, .sas). The
templates will be populated with project information you provide. The
package also contains a set of functions that allow you to create
additional templates as needed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sociome from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CU-Anschutz-DOS-CORP/startProject")
library(startProject)  
```
