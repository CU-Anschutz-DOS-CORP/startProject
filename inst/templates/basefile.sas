 * Customize your SAS template by either creating a .basefile.sas file in your
 * HOME directory or by modifying the basefile.sas file found in the
 * templates folder of the library installation. 
 * To find your home directory, run `Sys.getevn("HOME")`. To find the location,
 * of the installed template file run `system.file("templates", package = "startProject")`.
 * You can add SAS code and documentation that will appear here.
