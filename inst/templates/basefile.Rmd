# Customize your R template by either creating a .basefile.Rmd file in your
# HOME directory or by  modifying the basefile.Rmd file found in the templates 
# folder of the library installation. 
# To find your home directory, run `Sys.getevn("HOME")`. To find the location,
# of the installed template file run `system.file("templates", package = "startProject")`.
# You can add R code and documentation that will appear here. 
# Leave 1 blank line at the end of basefile.Rmd to avoid warning message.
