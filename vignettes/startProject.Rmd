```

The goal of `startProject` is to create a project directory with sub-folders and document templates (.docx, .R, .Rmd, .sas). The templates will be populated with project information you provide. The package also contains a set of functions that allow you to create additional templates if needed.

# Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:
```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CU-Anschutz-DOS-CORP/startProject")
library(startProject)  
```

# Initial directory creation

You can create a project directory with `startProject()` or by launching a [local Shiny App](#shinyapp) included in the package.

## startProject()

`startProject()` allows you to input project information and specify the sub-folders you want included. In addition, you can request the creation of memo, R, Rmd and/or SAS templates. If any of these templates are requested, the function will search for memo, rcode, r, sascode or sas sub-folders to store the corresponding template; if these are not found, a templates sub-folder will be created.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
startProject(
  main.dir = Sys.getenv("HOME"), 
  proj.name = "TestRProject", 
  proj.num = NULL,
  start.date = format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y"), 
  version = "1", 
  client = "John Smith",
  client.dept = "Testing Department", 
  main.statistician = "Rocio Lopez", 
  stats.collab = NULL
  subfolders = "communications, data, graphs, memo, orig_data, others, r, sas",
  templates = "memo, R, Rmd, sas",
  memo.name = NULL, 
  memo.re = "Get started with startProject",
  r.name = NULL, 
  r.purpose = "This R file displays the template generated by startProject", 
  r.notes = NULL,
  rmd.name = NULL,
  rmd.purpose =  "This Rmd file displays the template generated by startProject", 
  rmd.notes = NULL,
  sas.name = NULL, 
  sas.purpose =  "This SAS file displays the template generated by startProject", 
  sas.notes = NULL)
```

The directory created looks like this:

The project information (client, author, etc.) and template details (purpose, notes) are used to populate the templates. The templates created can be viewed [here](https://github.com/lopezr/public-files/tree/main/startProject). 

## shinyApp

If you prefer, you can launch a local Shiny app that will facilitate using `startProject()`. For details on the app and how create a short cut that allows accessing the startProject app without opening R, go [here](./lauchViaShinyApp.html).

# Customize templates

The package utilizes 4 document templates which can be customized:

1. memoTemplate.docx
2. basefile.R
3. basefile.Rmd
4. basefile.sas

To use customized templates you can either modify those included or save copies on your home directory (details below).

## Memo template

The header and layout in **memoTemplate.docx** can be modified but it is important to not change the names for the placeholders for information passed by the functions (DATESEC, TOSEC, etc.); if you want to omit the information you can delete the placeholder. 

You can save your modified template in your home directory (`Sys.getenv("HOME")`) and name it **.basefile.docx** (note the . before the filename); this basefile will override the included template in this and any future installation of the package.

You can also save a .staffInfo file in your home directory (`Sys.getenv("HOME")`) with your name, email and phone number to be inserted into the memo footer. Leave the last line blank to avoid a warning message in R. Your file should look like this:

![staffInfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lopezr/public-files/main/startProject/staffInfo.png)

## Code templates

The headers for the .R, .Rmd and .sas are generated by the `startProject` functions and cannot be changed. You can append code and comments under the generated header by either creating a .basefile (**.basefile.R, .basefile.Rmd or .basefile.sas**) in your home directory (`Sys.getenv("HOME")`) or by modifying the base file included in the package (instructions on [next section](#templates)); this allows you to add commonly used code to your templates. 

The base files included in the package have a note indicating that you can modify them; If you wish to generate the template(s) with only the header, simply delete the files or clear the current content. 

## Managing included template files {#templates}

You can physically delete or open and modify any of the template files included in the package. To find the location of the included template files, use `system.file("templates", package = "startProject")`. Note that the names of the files cannot be changed.

Some of these tasks can be done from within your R session.

To delete the .R template file, for example, you can use:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
unlink(paste0(system.file("templates", package = "startProject"), "/basefile.R"))
```

If you already have templates stored in a separate location, you can move the files using `file.copy()`. For example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.copy(
  "C:/FromDirectory", 
  system.file("templates", package = "startProject"), overwrite = TRUE) 
```

If the template file has the same name as the package template, this will overwrite the existing template with yours. If your template has a different file name, then you must rename it.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.rename(
  paste0(system.file("templates", package = "startProject"), "/YourTemplateNameHere.R"), 
  paste0(system.file("templates", package = "startProject"), "/basefile.R"))
```

This will overwrite the existing template with yours. 

It is strongly recommended you have .basefiles in your home directory or store copies of your modified templates in a separate location and use the above functions to move the files into the package directory; this will facilitate package updates.
